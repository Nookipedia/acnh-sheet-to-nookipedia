# acnh-sheet-to-nookipedia
Mappings of rows from the ACNH sheet to their respective Nookipedia entries.

Item URLs are easy to systematically generate without a need for this spreadsheet, as the article titles are always in the format "Item:Acoustic_Guitar_(New_Horizons)" (item name just need to be title cased). While villagers and critters are predictable for the most part, there are exceptions due to the need to disambiguate (e.g. are article on villager June is located "June_(villager)" to disambiguate from the article on the month of June).
